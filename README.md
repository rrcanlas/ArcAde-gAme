## Building Out the Games Functionality

This project have an existing **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** provided by UDACITY. Changes can be found on the app.js. Instructions are given to be coded. Objects for the player and enemies were instantiated on the app.js. 

I positioned the enemies and the player on the canvas with their designated x and y coordinates. Functions on keys to press does exist, I just added a method to position the player with every arrow keys to be pressed. I generated a condition statement to check whether the player was able to reach the it's goal **added points** /play tada or collided with the enemy **reset's score to :zero:** /play noooo.
