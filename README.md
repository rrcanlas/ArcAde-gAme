## Directions for the Game 

- Press :arrow_up: Up, :arrow_down: Down, :arrow_left: Left or :arrow_right: Right on the Keyboard to move the player.

- **Avoid** hitting the Enemy /play dangerzone.

- Keep on going :arrow_up: up to reach the river and score points. 

- Upon :scream: collision of the player and the enemy, score points **resets to :zero:**. 

## Building Out the Games Functionality

This project have an existing **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** provided by UDACITY. Changes can be found on the app.js. Instructions are given to be coded. Objects for the player and enemies were instantiated on the app.js. 

I positioned the enemies and the player on the canvas with their designated x and y coordinates. Functions on keys to press does exist, I just added a method to position the player with every arrow keys to be pressed. I generated a condition statement to check whether the player was able to reach the it's goal **added points** /play tada or collided with the enemy **reset's score to :zero:** /play noooo.
